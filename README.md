# Goal
In this notebook, we apply the Intelligent search methods like Differential Evolution Algorithm to find the best ML algorithm hyper-parameters. Previous options are using either predetermined or randomly generated parameters for the ML algorithms. Some of these searching methods are actually a simulation of Intelligent agents in nature like the folk of birds or school of fishes.

### Project Statement
---

### Searching Algorithm of your choice
---

### ML algorithm of your choice
Let's use the most Common ML Competition algorithm which is XGBoost.
---

### Preparing a dataset
Make balanced data set. Read all 1 values from the train data set and then add the same number of 0 and keep it. Now we do have a balance data set with an equal number of 0 and 1.
