# Goal
In this notebook, we apply the Intelligent search methods like Differential Evolution Algorithm to find the best ML algorithm hyper-parameters. Previous options are using either predetermined or randomly generated parameters for the ML algorithms. Some of these searching methods are actually a simulation of Intelligent agents in nature like the folk of birds or school of fishes.
